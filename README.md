## Marvel Character Browser App
This project demonstrates an efficient approach to browsing, managing, and displaying data from the Marvel library within an Android application.

## Project Overview
This application allows users to browse a list of Marvel characters retrieved from the Marvel API, view detailed information about each character, and explore related comics, series, stories, and events.

## Key Features Implemented

1. Clean Architecture: This project is structured using clean architecture principles to separate concerns across various layers, resulting in improved modularity and code maintenance:
   
   1. Core Layer: Houses business logic that remains platform-independent.
   2. Data Layer: Manages data access, such as API calls and database operations.
   3. Domain Layer: Defines domain-specific data models and business logic.
   4. Presentation Layer: Manages UI interactions, state, and communicates with ViewModels.
   5. Application Layer: Integrates all layers into a cohesive application.

This structure provides high maintainability, testability, and scalability for the codebase

2. Model-View-Intent (MVI) Architecture: MVI was adopted to handle user interactions, application state, and data flow, ensuring a predictable and manageable code structure.
   
   1. ViewModel: Handles user actions (intents), updates state (model), and interacts with the data layer.
   2. View State: Represents the data required by the UI to render, such as character details or loading states.
   3. Single Source of Truth: The ViewModel acts as a single source of truth for the application state, ensuring data consistency.

This approach simplifies handling complex UI interactions and asynchronous data flows.


3. Coroutines and Flow: Asynchronous operations like data fetching and state updates are managed with coroutines and Kotlin Flow.

   1. Background Tasks: Use of coroutines to manage asynchronous operations and background tasks.
   2. Reactive Updates: Flow emits data updates from the ViewModel to the UI reactively, ensuring a smooth user experience.
These asynchronous patterns enable efficient data handling and keep the UI responsive.

4. Kotlin Language: The project is developed entirely in Kotlin, leveraging its features like type safety, null-safety, and concise syntax.

   1. Data Models: Marvel character data and related entities are defined using Kotlin data classes.
   2. ViewModels: Logic is implemented using Kotlin coroutines and flows, providing a modern approach to asynchronous programming.

6. Jetpack Compose: The app’s UI is built using Jetpack Compose, Android’s modern, declarative UI toolkit.

1. Composable Functions: UI components are defined using composable functions.
2. Dynamic Layouts: Layouts are responsive and adapt to data changes in the ViewModel's View State.

Jetpack Compose allows a more intuitive way to build UI and handle state changes in real-time.

## Application Features
1. Character List: Users can scroll through a list of Marvel characters retrieved from the Marvel API, with infinite scroll to load additional characters.
2. Character Details: By selecting a character, users can view more detailed information, including comics, series, stories, and events they appear in.

## Advantages of the App
1. Organized Marvel Data: This app offers a centralized platform to browse and explore Marvel character data.
2. Offline Support: Local data storage with Room allows the app to retain data for offline viewing.
3. Efficient Data Flow: MVI architecture ensures smooth data handling and error management, reducing the risk of inconsistencies and improving app reliability.

## Project Organization
* In this project I'm using [Clean architecture with MVI Pattern](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/docs/guide) to provide an organized and modularized application structure. The structure is illustrated below:

## Benefits of the Architecture

1. Encapsulation: Each layer is encapsulated, making the codebase modular, easier to navigate, and better suited for unit testing.
2. Single Responsibility Principle: Layers and classes serve a single purpose, improving the maintainability of the code.
3. Separation of Concerns: MVI and architecture patterns separate data handling from UI logic, leading to a cleaner codebase and a more predictable data flow.
